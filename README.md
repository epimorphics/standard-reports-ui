# Price Paid Standard Reports UI

This is the HM Land Registry [Standard Reports UI](http://landregistry.data.gov.uk/app/standard-reports),
a web application that allows users to define and download Price Paid Standard Reports.
Standard Reports aggregate slices of Price Paid (PPD) data by property type, region, and date.
Users step through a wizard interface making selections for the various report criteria, then
download the selected report. This kicks off a background batch job via the Standard Reports
Manager API, which either returns immediately with a cached report download link or provides
a queue position as the job works through the batch queue.

Please see the other repositories in the [HM Land Registry Open
Data](https://github.com/epimorphics/hmlr-linked-data/) project for more details.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Backend | Ruby on Rails, served via Puma |
| Assets | Sprockets + Dart Sass (dartsass-sprockets) |
| Templates | HAML |
| Data | Standard Reports Manager API queried via Faraday |
| Maps | Leaflet |
| Error tracking | Sentry |
| Metrics | Prometheus (`prometheus-client`, `puma-metrics`) |

This is a server-rendered Rails application with no Node.js build tooling. There is
no Vite and no Webpack. Node is used only to run Playwright E2E tests — it is not
part of the application build.

## Developer setup

### 1. Install Ruby

Use [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) or [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com) to install
the version pinned in `.ruby-version` (currently `3.4.9`).

With rbenv:

```bash
rbenv install        # reads .ruby-version automatically
gem install bundler
```

### 2. Authenticate with the private gem registry

The `json_rails_logger` and `lr_common_styles` gems are hosted on the Epimorphics
GitHub Package Registry. You need a GitHub Personal Access Token with the
`read:packages` scope.

Configure Bundler with your token:

```bash
./bin/bundle config set --local rubygems.pkg.github.com epimorphics:<your-token>
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
./bin/bundle install
```

No Node or Yarn installation is required for the Ruby setup. See [E2E testing](#e2e-testing) below if you also want to run Playwright tests.

### 4. Environment variables

`.env.development` contains sensible defaults for local development and is checked
in — no copying required. The app will start without any further configuration.

To override a value, create `.env.local` and set it there — Rails loads `.env.local`
first and falls back to `.env.development`. `.env.local` is gitignored.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `API_SERVICE_URL` | `http://localhost:8081` | Standard Reports Manager API |
| `PORT` | `3003` | Rails server port |
| `METRICS_PORT` | `9396` | Prometheus metrics port |
| `SENTRY_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable Sentry error tracking |
| `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` | — | Required only for production builds (source map upload) |
| `SENTRY_API_KEY` | — | Required only if `SENTRY_ENABLED=true` |

## Data API

The app queries a backing Standard Reports Manager API at `API_SERVICE_URL` (default
`http://localhost:8081`). Refer to the
[standard-reports-manager](https://github.com/epimorphics/standard-reports-manager)
repository for instructions on running it locally.

## Running locally

```bash
./bin/rails server -p 3003
```

The app is served on port 3003 by default and expects the Manager API at `API_SERVICE_URL`
(see `.env.development`).

## Testing

```bash
./bin/rails test
```

Tests use VCR cassettes under `fixtures/vcr_cassettes/`. To discard cassettes and force
live HTTP calls on the next run:

```bash
rm fixtures/vcr_cassettes/*
```

View the coverage report after a test run:

```bash
open coverage/index.html
```

## E2E testing

Playwright is used for end-to-end browser automation. Node is required only for this:
it is not used in the application build.

**Prerequisites:** Node 24 via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm):

```bash
nvm install   # reads .nvmrc automatically
nvm use
```

**Install dependencies** (yarn resolves from `.yarn/releases/yarn-4.15.0.cjs` via
`yarnPath` in `.yarnrc.yml` — no separate corepack step needed):

```bash
yarn install
```

**Run against the local server** (starts Rails automatically on port 3003):

```bash
yarn test:e2e
```

**Interactive UI mode:**

```bash
yarn test:e2e:ui
```

**Open the last HTML report:**

```bash
yarn test:e2e:report
```

### Running against a deployed environment

Set `E2E_BASE_URL` to any URL from [Environments](#environments). For
pre-production, also pass the Basic Auth [credentials](#credentials):

```bash
E2E_BASE_URL=https://hmlr-preprod-pres.epimorphics.net/app/standard-reports/ \
E2E_USERNAME=user \
E2E_PASSWORD=secret \
yarn test:e2e
```

### In CI

The **E2E Tests** workflow (`.github/workflows/e2e.yml`) is manual only: run it
from **Actions > E2E Tests > Run workflow**. It always targets pre-production.
The dev hosts are too small to complete some of the large queries the suite
makes, so runs against dev fail for reasons unrelated to the code.

## Linting

```bash
./bin/bundle exec rubocop -a    # Ruby — auto-corrects safe offences
```

There is no JavaScript linting (no JS build tooling) and no HAML linting configured.

## Building and publishing

> [!WARNING]
> Do not trigger deployments concurrently. ukhpi, ppd-explorer,
> standard-reports-ui and lr-landing all deploy to the same hosts with the
> same Ansible playbook, and nothing stops two deploys from overlapping. Before
> pushing to `dev`, `preprod` or `prod`, check the Actions tab of all four
> repositories and wait for any deploy in progress to finish.

The `Makefile` is scoped to the Docker image build and publish pipeline.

```bash
make image     # Build the Docker image (requires GitHub token configured)
make publish   # Push to AWS ECR
make vars      # Print all build variables
make tag       # Print the computed image tag
make version   # Print the application version
```

Variables can be overridden on the command line, e.g.:

```bash
STAGE=preprod make publish
```

Branch-to-environment mapping is defined in `deployment.yaml`. CI runs
`publish` and `deploy` automatically on push via
`.github/workflows/publish-deploy.yml`.

## Releases

Releases follow the [Frontend Release Process](https://github.com/epimorphics/internal/wiki/Release-Process-Frontend).

The canonical version file is `app/lib/version.rb`. The changelog is maintained in `CHANGELOG.md`.

Environment branches are kept as strict fast-forward pointers to tagged commits on `dev`. URLs for each environment are listed under [Environments](#environments).

## Environments

| Branch | Environment | URL | Basic Auth |
|--------|-------------|-----|------------|
| `dev` | Dev | https://hmlr-dev-pres.epimorphics.net/app/standard-reports/ | No |
| `preprod` | Pre-production | https://hmlr-preprod-pres.epimorphics.net/app/standard-reports/ | Yes |
| `prod` | Production | https://landregistry.data.gov.uk/app/standard-reports/ | No |

Pushing to an environment branch builds, publishes and deploys to that
environment (see [Building and publishing](#building-and-publishing)).

### Credentials

Pre-production is protected by HTTP Basic Auth. The credentials are not stored
in this repository: ask Ops for them. The E2E workflow reads the same
credentials from the `E2E_USERNAME` and `E2E_PASSWORD` repository secrets.

## Observability

Metrics for the presentation hosts of all HMLR apps are in
[Grafana](https://grafana-hmlr.epimorphics.net/). Use it to see how each
environment has behaved over time and to line up a problem with when it
started. Ask Ops for access.

## Dependency maintenance

```bash
./bin/bundle update --patch              # Update all gems to latest patch version
./bin/bundle outdated --only-explicit    # Check for outdated gems
```
